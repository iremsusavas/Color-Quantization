# Color Quantization
Color quantization or color image quantization is quantization applied to *color spaces*
It is a process that reduces the number of distinct colors used in an image, usually with the intention that the new imaga should be as visually similar as possible to the original image.
There are different kinds of algorithms applied for color quantization.


In this project the names of the algorithms used and Matlab folders which contains these algorithms are written below:
- Uniform Color Quantization Algorithm (uniform.m)
- Popularity Algorithm  (popularity.m)
- Median Cut Algorithm (mediancutMain.m)
- K-Means Algorithm (kkmeans.m)
